      <h2>We were powerless - Sunday, October 12, 2025</h2>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I’ve been reflecting on step 1 quite a bit recently, for a few different reasons. Part of it is that I try to actively work step 1 every day, another part is I’m supposed 
        to be working my step 1 right now as I start a new set ( I say “supposed to be” because there isn’t a whole lot of intentional work happening right now), and also because 
        my sponsee is working their step 1 at the moment. It’s also a common meeting topic, so it’s very present in my life right now. What it’s really got me thinking about is my 
        time as an ESL teacher in South Korea.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I spent 4 years in Korea from 2017 to 2021, and before I got there I was working through a phase of “white knuckling.” My drug of choice (DOC) is alcohol. Back in 2012, 
        I got a DUI and lost my license (that reaaally sucked as I was living in Fort St. John and it was winter time). I’m not complaining about it. I got what I deserved and 
        I’m endlessly grateful I didn’t hurt anyone while I was driving drunk. It was this incident that started this 5 years stretch of on and off white knuckling. I certainly 
        wasn’t clean and sober for the whole 5 year stretch but I did manage to curtail my use quite considerably. Enough so that by the time I moved to Korea, I was under the 
        delusion that I could control myself.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        The “reintroduction” of substance was casual enough. “Go out for drinks after a hard week of teaching?? Why not??” Of course I thought I was in complete control and 
        could regulate myself. That thinking quickly evolved into competition. The local Irish bar (yes there was a local Irish bar in the city I was in... owned and operated 
        by a really cool Irish guy!) had this “shot list” you could do. The idea being you successfully do every shot on the list and you got your name on the wall and got to 
        add the next shot to the list. Now most people just casually went through this thing in hopes of completing it. Not me. My addiction and competitive nature were running 
        rampant. I got my name on that wall 4 times. Along with the embarrassment of being told the bar was thinking of putting a limit on how many you could order in one night, 
        because of me. Yet I was still under the delusion I was in control. This all occurred during my first 2 years over there. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        The end of May 2018, I got a message from my brother telling me to call him. I had a gut feeling this was not good. I remember that much. He informed me that our dad 
        had passed away. I knew he was in the hospital. He had been there for about 2 weeks. I spoke to him on Skype just before he went into the hospital, and that was the 
        last time I ever spoke to him. I wish I could say it was a good conversation or I remember it fondly. I was loaded and can’t remember it at all. I took 6 days off work 
        to go to England for his funeral and wake. So much of this time is a blur or blank to me. Partly because I was in shock, but also because I stopped even pretending to 
        try to control my using. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I was already drinking daily and still managed to step it up. I was getting blackout drunk on soju every day. Going to work horribly hung over, or still drunk from 
        the previous night’s drinking. Spending my weekends sitting in my apartment eating pizza, drinking from sunrise to whenever I passed out, and smoking on the roof. 
        My friends/fellow teachers were noticeably concerned. Some things were said, I don’t remember what. And I continued like that until I eventually came home in April 
        2021. It was also during the tail end of my time in Korea that I came out as transgender, but I’ll save that story for my Quantum Transition page. I remember, before 
        I was set to come home, talking to my brother about growing concerns for my mom and her drinking. I do remember telling him I was having a problem but I he was under 
        the impression our mom was worse and I didn’t challenge him on that. I let him think that was the case. I lied. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        My return to Canada was not an easy transition thanks to all the covid precautions. Somehow I made it back home. The plan was to live with my brother and niece. 
        We did that and it did not go well. I was a problem, to say the least. By June, it was “heavily suggested” I got to treatment or detox. Having spent all my money 
        getting loaded, treatment wasn’t an option (at least that was what we thought at that time). So I got into Clearview Detox and spent a week there in mid July. I 
        spent most of my time reading. I read all of Gabor Maté’s book <em>In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts</em>. For those who haven’t read it, I highly recommend it. I won’t 
        go into it much here but it’s about Maté’s time in Vancouver’s downtown east-side trying to help the addicts there, and his reflections on addiction. After detox, 
        I did the whole outpatient treatment, tried a couple AA meetings and decided they weren’t for me (because I clearly knew better), and managed to stay clean for about 
        5 months. Then I had a day I didn’t have the tools to handle. I relapsed, tried to kill myself, and was sexually assaulted, in that order, on Dec 15 of 2021. At least 
        I can say that got me into the program. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I reached out to the woman who became my first sponsor, after connecting with her in a Facebook group for local trans individuals. I sought connection for the 
        purposes of aiding my transition and instead found one of the most wonderful people I have ever met. She just told me, “There’s a new meeting starting on Monday 
        night. Let’s go and make it our homegroup.” So I did just that. It took me another several months to actually get clean. I would go to that Monday night meeting, 
        or zoom in, then immediately go get loaded. The beginning of May 2022 was when I first got clean in the rooms. I wish I could say that is still my clean date. It 
        is not. But that’s okay now. I was now in the program of NA. I was starting to listen. I was starting to connect with people. I may have relapsed after 6 months 
        in the rooms, but since then I am gratefully able to say I am still clean and just about a month away from taking 3 years. This time around, I worked on active 
        listening, did 90 meetings in 90 days, got a sponsor, worked the steps, started to really make connections with the lovely women in the local rooms, and, for the 
        first time in my life, started to develop a sense of spirituality. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I’m now in a place where I can comfortably-ish write about this stuff and post it on the internet for all to see. I have a job that I love, a car, a place to call 
        home with a lovely, plant-mama roommate, and the most genuine friendships in my whole life. My life is far from perfect, but I’m clean, I don’t hate myself, and I 
        have real connection. I’d call that a win.

      <h2>And so it begins... - Sunday, October 5, 2025</h2>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I'm honesty not all that sure where to begin. I'm a few years into my recovery journey, sitting at my computer after getting this site all ready to go, 
        listening to <em>Golden</em> from <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> on a repeating loop, and I'm kind of at a loss. Where is the line between airing my 
        dirty laundry on the internet and sharing my experience, strength, and hope with you?? What do I say, what do I not say. I have values of honesty, authenticity, 
        and integrity I want to uphold. The goal here is not for me to vent. It's to provide some context to my experiences as an addict in the hopes that someone will 
        read it and realize that they aren't alone.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I suppose I can treat this a little like a step 1 share. For me, powerlessness was so apparent even if I didn't want to accept it. The number of times I would 
        be going to use and literally screaming at myself in my head to not do it. For those who know, you know, but for those who don't, that feeling of not being able 
        to stop yourself no matter how much you try is not only scary and frustrating, it makes you believe you have some kind of moral failing or weakness. Even now, 
        I still feel so much shame and guilt over it. I know better now but that doesn't change those feelings. They are still there. I know addiction is a disease. I 
        have to remind myself of that fact often or the feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness will claw their way into my head and take me down a horrible spiral. 
        That's the thing that "normies" (what we call non-addicts) can't always understand. There is no "cure" to this. Addicts have to constantly work our program to 
        maintain ourselves. If I'm doing the things, like meetings, connecting with fellow addicts, steps, talking to my sponsor, building a relationship with my higher 
        power, then I know that I'm going to be okay. Even when I'm facing life on life's terms, I can get through it if I have my people and my program.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        In no way do I have any delusions (presently) about where I am at in my recovery. I happen to be doing well. I have a job I like, a relationship with my family, 
        wonderful friends, and hobbies & activities that bring me joy. That doesn't mean I can drop the ball on my recovery. It means I'm doing all the things I should be.
        Although, full disclosure, my meeting attendance of late hasn't been all that great. I've made excuses not to go to meetings like "I'm too tired" or "I'm feeling 
        okay right now. I don't need to go." Recovery requires diligence. Look away for a moment and you can end up relapsing. It's happened to me. I know it could happen 
        again, if I stop "taking my medicine." I've heard of people with years, even decades, relapsing because they became complacent. I think that's one of my biggest fears.
        Not that it could happen, but that if it does happen, it's because I didn't stop it. A relapse is often weeks, or months, sometimes years, in the making. I don't go to
        meetings because I think I'll immediately go pick up. I go to give back what was freely given, and to remind myself where I came from and where I'll go back to if 
        I drop the ball. I can't control myself once I've picked up; that choice to pick up the first time is mine though. And today I'll be damned if I make that choice 
        consciously. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        So I'll leave you with this. Recovery is simple, but not easy. There is hope. You have to want it though. No one can do that for you. If you are struggling and need 
        a meeting, you can find a meeting: <a class="qfl-link" href="na.org">Narcotics Anonymous</a> or <a class="qfl-link" href="aa.org">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>. Get to a meeting, call the hotline, call another addict in recovery. 
        If you are having suicidal thoughts, dial 988 in Canada, or go to <a class="qfl-link" href="https://www.iasp.info/">The International Association for Suicide Prevention</a>. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        Please feel free to reach out to me to talk about recovery, transition, books, or quantum physics (don't expect me to be an expert though, just very enthusiastic). Just 
        visit my contact page to send me an email or reach out on one of my socials. Thanks for taking the time to visit me here, "Where chaos, compassion, and caffeine converge."
