      <h2>And so it begins... - Sunday, October 5, 2025</h2>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I'm honesty not all that sure where to begin. I'm a few years into my recovery journey, sitting at my computer after getting this site all ready to go, 
        listening to <em>Golden</em> from <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> on a repeating loop, and I'm kind of at a loss. Where is the line between airing my 
        dirty laundry on the internet and sharing my experience, strength, and hope with you?? What do I say, what do I not say. I have values of honesty, authenticity, 
        and integrity I want to uphold. The goal here is not for me to vent. It's to provide some context to my experiences as an addict in the hopes that someone will 
        read it and realize that they aren't alone.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I suppose I can treat this a little like a step 1 share. For me, powerlessness was so apparent even if I didn't want to accept it. The number of times I would 
        be going to use and literally screaming at myself in my head to not do it. For those who know, you know, but for those who don't, that feeling of not being able 
        to stop yourself no matter how much you try is not only scary and frustrating, it makes you believe you have some kind of moral failing or weakness. Even now, 
        I still feel so much shame and guilt over it. I know better now but that doesn't change those feelings. They are still there. I know addiction is a disease. I 
        have to remind myself of that fact often or the feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness will claw their way into my head and take me down a horrible spiral. 
        That's the thing that "normies" (what we call non-addicts) can't always understand. There is no "cure" to this. Addicts have to constantly work our program to 
        maintain ourselves. If I'm doing the things, like meetings, connecting with fellow addicts, steps, talking to my sponsor, building a relationship with my higher 
        power, then I know that I'm going to be okay. Even when I'm facing life on life's terms, I can get through it if I have my people and my program.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        In no way do I have any delusions (presently) about where I am at in my recovery. I happen to be doing well. I have a job I like, a relationship with my family, 
        wonderful friends, and hobbies & activities that bring me joy. That doesn't mean I can drop the ball on my recovery. It means I'm doing all the things I should be.
        Although, full disclosure, my meeting attendance of late hasn't been all that great. I've made excuses not to go to meetings like "I'm too tired" or "I'm feeling 
        okay right now. I don't need to go." Recovery requires diligence. Look away for a moment and you can end up relapsing. It's happened to me. I know it could happen 
        again, if I stop "taking my medicine." I've heard of people with years, even decades, relapsing because they became complacent. I think that's one of my biggest fears.
        Not that it could happen, but that if it does happen, it's because I didn't stop it. A relapse is often weeks, or months, sometimes years, in the making. I don't go to
        meetings because I think I'll immediately go pick up. I go to give back what was freely given, and to remind myself where I came from and where I'll go back to if 
        I drop the ball. I can't control myself once I've picked up; that choice to pick up the first time is mine though. And today I'll be damned if I make that choice 
        consciously. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        So I'll leave you with this. Recovery is simple, but not easy. There is hope. You have to want it though. No one can do that for you. If you are struggling and need 
        a meeting, you can find a meeting: <a class="qfl-link" href="na.org">Narcotics Anonymous</a> or <a class="qfl-link" href="aa.org">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>. Get to a meeting, call the hotline, call another addict in recovery. 
        If you are having suicidal thoughts, dial 988 in Canada, or go to <a class="qfl-link" href="https://www.iasp.info/">The International Association for Suicide Prevention</a>.

        Please feel free to reach out to me to talk about recovery, transition, books, or quantum physics (don't expect me to be an expert though, just very enthusiastic). Just 
        visit my contact page to send me an email or reach out on one of my socials. Thanks for taking the time to visit me here, "Where chaos, compassion, and caffeine converge."
