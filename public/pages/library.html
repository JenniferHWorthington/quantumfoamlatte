      <h2>Fae & "Fuck..." - Monday, October, 6 2025</h2>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        Reading has been a passion of mine for most of my life. I've had ups and downs with it. Right now I'm coming out 
        of a down phase. With my mental health being, what can only be described as, a cluster fuck this past year, it's 
        been a real struggle for me to enjoy reading. What makes it extra frustrating is I was working my way through a 
        series I am really enjoying. The series <em>A Court of Thorns and Roses</em> was a fun read. Interesting characters, 
        great world building, and who doesn't love reading <em>Beauty & the Beast</em> for the first time a second time! But 
        seriously, I don't think I would have been able to get through anything else during that rough time. I struggled with 
        focus, concentration, and experiencing joy. <em>ACOTAR</em> was captivating and had me always wanting to know what 
        happens next, even though I had to put it down for, sometimes, months at a time. I was always able to pick up where I 
        left off and just be immersed in the world and characters. Thank you <em>Sarah J. Maas</em>!
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        As already stated, I'm just coming out of a long-term funk when it comes to reading. I had to put down the fifth book 
        <em>A Court of Silver Flames</em>. That was incredibly difficult for me to do. My tism thrives on completion of sets, 
        so making the decision to try reading something else for a while was not easy, by any means. But so far, I'm pleasantly 
        surprised by how shift has been doing my reading habits a world of good. I'm fighting the temptation to just jump back 
        to <em>Silver Flames</em>. I know I need to let the palette cleanser do its job before I finish up <em>ACOTAR</em>. Of 
        course, I just had to switch to reading something I'm just loving! But we'll come back to that.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I'm very selective in what I read, and re-readability is huge for me. I don't really read reviews on books or authors. 
        I just kind of feel it out and something either grabs my attention or it doesn't. I have books on bookshelf I'm definitely 
        going to read... just in due course. Sometimes I want a comfort book; something I've read over and over for its familiarity 
        and because its like a blanky in word form. My tastes tend to stay in the realm of sci-fi, fantasy, romantacy (thank you 
        Kelsey, Gab, and Janelle for that!), physics, self-help (cause I fucking need it!), and LGBTQ+ topics. That being said, I'm 
        not limited to those topics. You're just more likely to find me reading something in that realm.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        Alright! Back to my current read. I've started reading <em>The Last Wish</em>, from <em>The Witcher</em> series. I'm loving it! 
        It's basically a collection of short stories (which makes it really manageable for me at the moment) that follow Geralt during a 
        time before the events of the main series. I already was familiar with <em>The Witcher</em> from the video games, especially 
        <em>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</em>. Then I was really excited to find out <em>Henry Cavill</em> would be playing Geralt in 
        the Netflix series. I'm disappointed he left; he WAS Geralt. I'm going to give <em>Liam Hemsworth</em> a fair shot though. Anyway, 
        back to the books. I'm really looking forward to following Geralt's journey through the Continent and updating you all on what I 
        think as I go through this series. I'm just so grateful that I'm able to sit down and read for more than 10 minutes at a time again.

        With that, I leave you. Thank you for visiting the site and taking the time to read. If you want to stay in the loop when I post, 
        please go to my contact page (A.K.A. Write Me a Note) and follow me on my socials. I try to post about anything that's new within 
        the Foam. Toodles!
