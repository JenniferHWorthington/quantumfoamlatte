      <h2>Redefining self - Monday, October 6, 2025</h2>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I'm off sick from work today so I decided that while I'm bundled up feeling like garbage, I might as well try to 
        get some work done here. This entry is even more scary to write than the first one in Recovery Corner. I feel like 
        I'm a lot more exposed here. Addiction and recovery is disease and healing, but my transition journey is about my core 
        identity. And who am I? Well I'm a nearly 40 year old lesbian trans woman. But those are just labels. They don't capture 
        the essence of me, or the work and sacrifice I went through to redefine who I am. Some of it was really exciting and 
        liberating. Some of it felt like grief. And all of it has felt and continues to feel overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I suppose I should explain a few about transition, or at least, my experience with transition. Before I realized I was trans, 
        I wasn't a man. I was and always have been a trans woman. My lack of awareness on this doesn't make it not true before realization. 
        I was a woman doing everything in her power to pass as a man because that's all I knew. I always knew something was off but 
        couldn't express it because I didn't have the vocabulary. There was this dissonance I couldn't resolve. Throughout my late 20s and 
        early 30s, I kept having these moments or experiences where I almost got it. Looking back it's so frustrating I didn't get it at the 
        time. But that just wasn't my journey. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I feel like some of my not getting it was denial. I knew on some level but just couldn't accept it. And to me, that makes a lot of 
        sense. Internalized transphobia is something I have a great deal of experience with. Don't get me wrong. I was always accepting of 
        trans identities, just not for me. It was okay for other people. That internatized hate was so bad that when I finally realized that 
        I'm trans, I almost jumped off a building. I just didn't think I could have any kind of life worth living. And once I had that realization, 
        there was no going back. Sure, I could have made the choice to not transition and continue living the way I had been, but that's not 
        what I mean. I mean I <em>knew</em>. That wasn't ever going away. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        Thankfully it didn't stay that way. Ever since then, I just keep putting one foot in front of the other and persist. What started as a 
        "Fuck You!" to the world has become something beautiful. I <em>get</em> to redefine what it means to be me. I had to start small though 
        and I needed near inifite fucking patience. Although I did just blurt it out to the world on Facebook and to my friends and family. That 
        part I did quickly. I was all in. Talk about a 180. Within 3 days I went from standing on the ledge of the roof of a 10 story building to 
        sending messages to anyone who would listen. I made my social transition quick. I did have to wait a few months to really transition 
        socially as I was still living in South Korea at the time. But once I got back to Canada, I was Jennifer. Sometimes I can't believe it took 
        me 35 years to realize and come out, but as a friend of mine told me "The hardest person to come out to is yourself." After the rocky start, 
        I made quick changes. Then I was halted in my tracks.
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I felt very stifled and frustrated by the medical system while trying to get on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). I returned to Canada in 
        April of 2021 and waited until August to start HRT. It was a lot of frustrating waiting and trying to find alternatives. I did my best to 
        learn and practice what I could; makeup, fashion, etc. I still remember how nerve-wracking it was getting my ears pierced or going out in 
        public in slightly feminine clothing. But that's part of the process. Taking those baby steps toward building a new sense of self. If I had 
        done it any other way I probably would have had more trouble. Sometimes slower is faster.  
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        Jumping ahead a bit here as much of the topics I could talk about now deserve their own dedicated post. I did the things and slowly made changes 
        to my clothes, hair, mannerisms, voice, walk, whatever you can think of really. I slowly became more social (out of necessity as I was also in early 
        recovery at this time) and made friends with many wonderful women who have been so kind and accepting. You all know who you are and I wouldn't 
        have survived addiction and transition without you üíú. 
      </p>
      <p class="qfl-entry">
        I'm going to cut this post a bit short on account of being sick. Yes, I know I could just save it and come back to it before I get it online. 
        But you know what? No. This just feels more authentic and organic to do it this way. Plus, it's my site and I can do what I want. A picture tells 
        a thousand words so I'm leaving you with 2. The one on the left is someone I hardly recognize anymore. It doesn't feel like that was ever me. I 
        was so miserable and depressed and suicidal. Not to say everything is puppies and rainbows now. Transitioning didn't fix my problems, but it did 
        make my problems worth fixing. The picture on the right is from before the Pride Sober Dance 2024. So not a picture from today (not that you want 
        to see me looking sick and disheveled; you can go visit my instagram to see that post from today) but it is probably one of my favorite pics of me 
        these days.

        There is much more to come. I'll be talking about all kinds of trans related topics from <em>How to's</em> to <em>Why me?</em> and much much more. 
        If there is a topic you'd like to hear more about, feel free to visit my contact page and email me or hit me up on one of my socials. For now I say 
        goodbye and thanks for reading. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
