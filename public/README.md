# ☕ Quantum Foam Latte

> *Where chaos gets caffeinated.*  
> A handcrafted digital sanctuary built at the intersection of philosophy, recovery, and creative technology.

## 🌌 Overview

**Quantum Foam Latte** is both a website and a living creative ecosystem — blending design, storytelling, and self-reflection.  
It serves as a personal laboratory for exploring meaning, recovery, identity, and artistry through digital craftsmanship.

The site (and larger project) acts as a digital home for essays, visual work, and philosophical experiments rooted in the *Quantum Foam Manifesto* — a poetic framework about living meaningfully in the midst of entropy.

---

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

At its core, **Quantum Foam Latte** believes in:
- **Tender honesty** — truth spoken softly is still truth.
- **Creative imperfection** — polish is overrated; presence is not.
- **Digital warmth** — code and compassion can coexist.
- **Curiosity over control** — the foam is the point, not the coffee beneath it.

This ethos shapes everything — from CSS architecture to prose rhythm.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

This project is built with a minimalist, hybrid approach designed for flexibility and learning:

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) + [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) |
| Structure | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP |
| Deployment | cPanel hosting (manual deployment) |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub |
| Design | Accessible, responsive, dark/light mode aware |

You can easily evolve this setup later — add Astro, Next.js, or a static generator when ready.

## 🪞 Creative Ecosystem

The *Quantum Foam Latte* project includes several interconnected works:

- **The Quantum Foam Manifesto** — the emotional and philosophical foundation.  
- **The Creator Reference Sheet** — a tone, mood, and style guide.  
- **Therapy Corner** — a gentle, reflective writing space focused on recovery and self-understanding.  
- **Site + Media** — the public expression of all the above, presented through design and writing.

Each piece informs the others. This is not a product — it’s a process.

## 🧭 Setup & Build

You can run and compile styles locally:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quantumfoamlatte.git

# Navigate to project folder
cd quantumfoamlatte

# Install dependencies (if any added later)
npm install

# Build Tailwind output
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./public/styles/tailwind.css --watch

# (Optional) Compile Sass
sass public/styles/sass/main.scss public/styles/main.css --watch
```

You can do this from the root project folder — it doesn’t matter which directory you’re in, as long as paths match your structure.
